					<h1>SpaceX Falcon 9 Ready for Liftoff</h1>
					<h2>Elon Musk prepares for first private space station dock</h2>

						CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida - Late last night the 178-foot-tall Falcon 9 rocket was moved out of its hangar at Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral and positioned on the launch pad. Today the rocket and Dragon capsule sit in the Florida sun waiting for tomorrow's 4:55 a.m. ET launch. The launch pad is leased by SpaceX from the Air Force and is the location of the previous two Falcon 9 launches.
						</p><p>
						Like everything at SpaceX, keeping costs low is the theme on the launch pad just as it is at the factory. The company has reclaimed items from the scrap heap and opted for water instead of concrete to keep the noise down.
						</p><p>
						The pad itself has been in use for decades and was used to launch Titan rockets between 1965 and 2005. Now it is one of two launch sites used by SpaceX, the other being at Vandenberg Air Force base in California. The company plans to develop a third launch pad of its own in the near future.
						</p><p>
						Tomorrow's launch window is a "near instantaneous" opportunity to lift off and make it to the International Space Station. The narrow window is dictated by the orbital path of the ISS and the need to preserve as much propellant as possible for the demonstration mission, rather than chasing the station on orbit. If the launch window is missed, the next satisfactory opportunity would not happen until Tuesday. There are other chances to launch, but they would require too much propellant to rendezvous with the ISS.
						</p><p>
						SpaceX has yet to perform a flawless countdown to launch during any of its previous missions. At a Friday press conference, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell acknowledged the delays during previous countdowns, but put the odds of a launch tomorrow at "better than 50/50." The weather forecast is relatively good, with only a 30 percent chance of weather interfering with the launch.
						</p><p>
						In addition to the launch pad itself, Launch Complex 40 is dominated by four lightning towers. Central Florida is famous for its thunderstorms, and lightning protection is ubiquitous at launch pads across Cape Canaveral. The towers are much taller than the Falcon 9 itself and are designed to serve as the conduit for lightning.
						</p><p>
						The large, white, round tank on the left is the storage tank for the liquid oxygen that serves as the oxidizer for the rocket engines. It was headed for the scrap heap when it was purchased at a bargain basement price by SpaceX. At 3 hours and 50 minutes before launch the liquid oxygen will be transferred into the Falcon 9. Ten minutes later the rocket-grade kerosene known as RP-1 will be loaded.
						</p><p>
						After being constructed in the SpaceX factory in Hawthorne, California, the Falcon 9 and Dragon are transported to Cape Canaveral and stored in a hangar (pictured above) adjacent to the pad. The fourth Falcon 9 rocket – set to lift off later this year – is already being processed in the hangar.
						</p><p>
						Most of the actual construction happens in Hawthorne, but roughly 80 SpaceX employees work full time at the launch pad year round performing a wide range of work, including final assembly and painting the rockets. A sign of the busy launch manifest, a crane is lifting steel beams as SpaceX expands its hangar space at the launch pad.
						</p><p>
						The complete rocket and capsule are assembled horizontally in the hangar while attached to the transporter erector device seen attached to the left of the rocket. The entire assembly is then moved a short distance to the pad, where hydraulic lifters elevate it to the vertical launch position.
						</p><p>
						At the top of the rocket sits the Dragon spacecraft. The first cylindrical section beneath the Dragon is the cargo trunk, which will stay attached to the capsule in orbit. Beneath the trunk is the top of stage two, which is a single-engine rocket used as the final boost to place the Dragon in orbit. The section with the Falcon 9 logo and U.S. flag is called the interstage and is effectively just a cover for the second-stage engine. The rest of the rocket comprises the first stage with the liquid oxygen stored on the top and the RP-1 kerosene just above the Merlin engines.

					<h3>Egyptian women feel excluded, despite the promise of the revolution</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<hr />
						<div class="author">By MARTIN SCORSESE</div>
						<p>
						CAIRO — After Egyptian women stood shoulder to shoulder with men in the protests that toppled Hosni Mubarak, many looked forward to a role in the revolution’s next steps. But 15 months later, as Egyptians prepare to vote for a new president this week, rights activists complain that women are being excluded from key decisions.
						</p><p>
						“At the time of the revolution, women were needed to fill out the numbers,” said Hoda Badran, head of the Egyptian Feminist Union, which was banned under Mubarak but reinstated last year. “Now, the decision-makers don’t need women, and we’re back to this idea that femininity is inferior and masculinity superior.”
						</p><p>
						Women hold just over 2 percent of the seats in Egypt’s new parliament, down from about 12 percent in the last elections held under Mubarak. The sharp decline followed the elimination of a quota to ensure women’s representation, which had been seen by many as a way to stack the body with members of Mubarak’s political party.
						</p><p>
						Military rulers did not include any women in the committee that wrote constitutional amendments adopted in a nationwide referendum last year. And there are no women among the 13 candidates who will be on the ballot Wednesday, when voting begins in the country’s first post-Mubarak presidential election.
						</p><p>
						Badran and other women’s rights activists are particularly worried that the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood will use its religious and charitable groups to encourage uneducated and poor women to vote for its candidate, Mohammed Morsi. Morsi opposes women being allowed to serve in the presidency. He has called for the implementation of Islamic law and, at campaign rallies, referred to Islam’s holy book, the Koran, as the constitution.
						</p><p>
						To counter the Brotherhood, Badran’s group has hired hundreds of buses to take women to the polls. It is also distributing pamphlets that encourage women to vote for a candidate who respects women, who doesn’t use religion to campaign and who doesn’t lie, Badran said. The group has not endorsed a candidate.
						</p><p>
						Among its Arab neighbors, Egypt boasts some of the strongest legal protections for women. Women here can sue for divorce. They are a significant part of the workforce, and they are not subject to an Islamic dress code. Egyptian women who are married to foreign men can pass on citizenship to their children, unlike in more socially liberal countries such as Lebanon, where they cannot.
						</p><p>
						But the Islamist-dominated parliament is discussing several proposals that could change women’s status here. They include lowering the legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 13 and revoking divorced mothers’ custody of their boys at age 7 and girls at 9, rather than at 15, a move that would be in accordance with a strict interpretation of Islamic law.
						</p><p>
						The existing rules were projects of Suzanne Mubarak, the former first lady, a strong advocate of laws to protect women and children’s rights. But she was also accused of monopolizing the issue and putting laws on the books that were never implemented, while independent women’s groups were not allowed to flourish.

					<h3>Silicon Valley takes Facebook fizzle in stride</h3>
					<img src="http://asset0.cbsistatic.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim/2012/05/09/FacebookIPO_610x426.jpg" class="col1" />

						<p>
						Facebook's lackluster initial public offering performance is a black eye for many on Wall Street and could have ramifications for similar upcoming deals such as an offering by Twitter, but venture capitalists in Silicon Valley are keen to shrug off Facebook's stumble - at least for now.
						</p><p>
						Any social networking companies planning IPOs might now be thinking twice, although the biggest companies currently aiming to tap public markets are enterprise-focused rather than consumer-focused, such as online-security company Palo Alto Networks, which has had IPO documents on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission since April.
						</p><p>
						"Whether (Facebook) is worth $95 billion or $100 billion, it's immaterial," said Jeremy Liew of Lightspeed Venture Partners, who has backed daily-deal company LivingSocial and others. Either way, he said, it is a lot of cash.
						</p><p>
						"I personally don't think it's going to hurt the tech IPO market hardly at all," said Dixon Doll of DCM.
						</p><p>
						It would not be the first time that Silicon Valley has played down setbacks. During the dotcom bust of 2000, some investors insisted for months that poor market conditions were temporary, even though they dragged on for years.
						</p><p>
						The biggest impact of an IPO that does not meet expectations, venture capitalists say, would normally be on valuations of similar companies, which would have less hope of going public. In this case, the private market value of fast-growing social-media companies, an area in which many people believe a bubble is emerging, would appear to be an area of concern.
						</p><p>
						However, many emerging players in social networking have raised money very recently. Online bulletin board site Pinterest raised money last week at a $1.5 billion valuation; question-and-answer site Quora raised $50 million recently.
						</p><p>
						The IPO window doesn't close in a day, venture capitalists argue. "I would not jump to premature conclusions," said Roelof Botha at Sequoia Partners.
